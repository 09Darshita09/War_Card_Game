# War_Card_Game
A simplified version of the card game 'WAR' simulated by Python OOP

==> Description : War game is played between two players where both will play a card in each round. The player with the highest card wins the round and gets both cards on the table. When both the players have same card, a 'WAR' is declared and then the players compare their cards for 11 war rounds, whoever has the highest card at the final round wins and gets all the cards on the table. The game ends when either of the player has no cards at all or not enough to play the war i.e. 11 cards.

==> Steps :
1. Both players will start off with half the deck.

2. You must press Enter to play each round. You can quit the game any time by 'Q'.

3. Each player plays a card. Higher card wins. Winner takes both cards. At each round the remaining cards for each player are displayed.

4. If players tie, then press enter to start the WAR. Each player puts down 11 cards, and the 11th card competes. (_Note: Here 11 war rounds are chosen to end the game quicker_) 

5. If a player has less than 11 cards, then player loses the game & game ends at WAR.

6. If players tie again inside an onging War then they again put down 11 cards and so on.

7. The player with highest 11th card wins the WAR and gets all the card on played in the WAR.

8. After the WAR, again each player plays one card and the game continues until either of the player is out of cards. 
  
The Goal is to collect the entire deck of cards and hope that your favourite player (1 or 2) always has the highest card. 😁🤞

Here is Player 2 winning the Game !!
